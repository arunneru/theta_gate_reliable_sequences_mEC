# theta_gates_reliable_sequences_mEC
Helper files and libraries used for simulations

## Usage

### Step 1 - Getting to know insilico
Peruse README.md in https://github.com/CollinsAssisi/insilico.
I have included in each subfolder, a seperate insilico folder with all the header files necessary for running the simulations.
Each folder is self-sufficient as a result.

### Step 2 - Interfacing python with insilico
I have used python and bash in linux to generate the helper files (nsets-holds neuron paramters, ssets-holds synapse parameters) required for insilico and to compile and run the simulations.

### Step 2a
Follow the notebook How_To_Neuron to get a sense of how to use insilico + python to run a simulation of a single neuron
### Step 2b
Follow the notebook How_To_Network to get a sense of how to use insilico + python to run a simulation of synaptically coupled neurons

## Step 3 -  Steps to generate figures

*Fig 1.*

0. enter into the folder "I2E2"

1. Generate the helper files (nsets, ssets)

```bash
python scripts/gen_nsets_I2E2_autonomous.py
python scripts/gen_nsets_I2E2_autonomous.py
python scripts/gen_ssets_I2E2.py
```

2. Compile the main cpp file which has specifications for the number of neurons, neuron types, number of synapses, synapse types and so on.

```bash
./scripts/compilemany_I2E2_autonomous.sh
./scripts/compilemany_I2E2_toggle.sh
```

3. Run the simulation

```bash
python scripts/run_a_I2E2_switching_autonomous.py
pyton scripts/run_a_I2E2_switching_toggle.py
```

After the simulation is over, the outputs would have been stored in the folder dir_output.
use the accompanying plotting script to produce a figure similar to Fig.1.

```bash
python scripts/plot_data.py <dir_output/filename.dat>
```

*Fig 2. & Fig 4. - Theta vs. No Theta in a larger network*

0. enter into the folder I40E40
1. Generate the helper files (nsets, ssets)

```bash
python scripts/gen_nsets_I40E40_shorterPulse.py	
python scripts/gen_ssets_I40E40_randomEtoI_without_replacement.py
```

2. Compile the main cpp file with specifications for the number of neurons, neuron types, number of synapses, synapse types and so on.

```bash
./scripts/compile_many_I40E40_variablePulse.sh
```

3. run the simulation

```bash
python scripts/run_a_I40E40_randomei.py
```

4. Calculate the spike times

```bash
python scripts/calc_spike_times.py
```

5. produce the raster plots

```bash
python scripts/plot_raster.py
```


6. Two figures are generated: 1) *without_theta_raster.png*, 2) *with_theta_raster.png*
